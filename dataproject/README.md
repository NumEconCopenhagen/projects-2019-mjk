# Dataproject - Development in exchange rates from 1999 to 2018

This project investigates the development from 1999 to 2018 for the following exchange rates; EUR, USD, GBP, CHF, CAD and AUD (measured in DKK per 100 units currency) by descriptive statistics and making an index in order to see the relative development. 

The motivation for investigating this, is that exchange rates have a big impact on export and import between countries, i.e. the changes in the exchange rates will affect the competitiveness for a given country.

In the first part of the project we download and structure data from Denmark Statistics table DNVALA. To get an overview, the descriptive analysis is carried and visualized through a boxplot. Afterwards the absolute and relative development of the exchange rates are illustrated graphically through plots.

For detailed explanation we refer to the notebook where the code is contained.
