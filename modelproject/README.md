# Modelproject - Cournot competition

In order to use the interactively plots the reader needs to download the code. 

There are many difficult courses on the economics study on the University of Copenhagen. One of the exams with lowest grade distributions is the course "Microeconomics I".  
We went to the exam on the 16th. january 2018, and we figured that solving and simulating the cournot-duopoly model as it was presented in the first assignment, would be our model of  interest. We will be comparing the results with the Stackelberg competition model, as this was a follow up question. This model can be seen as an extension to the Cournot model. We will first derive the general expressions and equations then we will plot using values from the exam. Lastly we will solve the model wrt. to output quantities, numerically.
